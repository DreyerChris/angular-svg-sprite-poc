# Angular SVG sprite POC

This POC is used to demonstrate the use of SVG sprites to create a generic component for SVG icons that can be modified inline. The file is loaded upon page load and is then cached for subsequent requests.

## Usage

```
npm install
```

```
ng serve --open
```

## Icons
Most of the icons come from the icomoon free icon pack and the icon names are the same. There are 2 additional icons to show multi-color capabilities:
`notification` and `color-circle`
